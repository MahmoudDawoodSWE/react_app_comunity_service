About the Organization
The "לאורו נלך" organization is an educational center for volunteering that operates in hundreds of high schools. The organization offers many volunteering activities, such as:

"מספרים באהבה" project - volunteers go to nursing homes and listen to the personal stories of the elderly population in Israel and document it.
"המשפחה שלי" project for immigrant children in elementary school.
"לא משאירים אותם לבד" project for commemoration of fallen soldiers on Memorial Day (in collaboration with the military cemeteries officer).
"חלקה טובה" project - volunteers visit military cemeteries in their city, learn about the personality of the soldier, organize a commemoration on the date of their fall, and establish contact with their family.
Project Goal
The goal of this project is to make the organization's material accessible to all volunteers and places of volunteering. This includes creating a more accessible application for data sharing with volunteers and creating a system for requests from volunteers and schools, with the ability to open a dialogue between different people on various topics. The project should also include creating a volunteering schedule system for volunteers and providing access to their personal information (volunteering hours and the fixed volunteering place) with reminders to volunteer. The project should also provide an automated system for generating signed forms for the convenience of the coordinators. The system should provide data analysis options to the management to improve the organization's volunteering activities.
